* Peak daily incidence: **857** cases on day **14**
* Attack rate: **23.4%** of population
* Case fatality rate: **4.2%** (95% CI: 3.5% - 4.9%)

**DAILY SIMULATION DATA**

| 30 | 234 | 12,456 | 2,456 | 521 | Mask Mandate, Social Distancing | 0.95 | 80.2% |

**INTERVENTION TIMELINE**

* Day 3: Mask Mandate implemented, compliance **92.1%**, estimated effect size **0.85**
* Day 10: Social Distancing implemented, compliance **80.9%**, estimated effect size **0.72**
* Day 15: Travel Restriction implemented, compliance **85.6%**, estimated effect size **0.78**

**HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IMPACT**

* Peak bed utilization: **92.1%** on day **20**
* Peak ICU utilization: **85.2%** on day **22**
* Healthcare worker infection rate: **12.5%**
* Critical resource shortages: 
	+ Ventilators: day **18** - **25**
	+ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): day **20** - **28**

**UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS**

* Model confidence score: **0.85** (justification: robust data sources, validated model structure)
* Key uncertainty sources: 
	1. Transmission rate variability
	2. Intervention compliance rates
	3. Healthcare system capacity
* Sensitivity analysis results: 
	+ Transmission rate: **±10%** impact on projected cases
	+ Intervention compliance: **±5%** impact on projected cases

**SCENARIO COMPARISONS**

* **No intervention scenario**: 
	+ Total projected cases: **25,678** (95% CI: 20,456 - 30,901)
	+ Peak daily incidence: **1,234** cases on day **18**
* **Optimal intervention scenario**: 
	+ Total projected cases: **9,012** (95% CI: 7,234 - 10,890)
	+ Peak daily incidence: **621** cases on day **12**
* **Resource-constrained scenario**: 
	+ Total projected cases: **15,678** (95% CI: 12,456 - 18,901)
	+ Peak daily incidence: **1,012** cases on day **20**

The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of interventions in reducing pneumonia transmission and highlight the importance of robust healthcare system capacity and compliance with public health measures.
