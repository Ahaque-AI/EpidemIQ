The most common symptoms are likely related to these four, with the patient in the given case having 4 symptoms. However, to directly answer the question, the data shows that the patient presents with 4 symptoms, but it doesn't specify one as more common than the others. A more accurate interpretation would be that the patient presents with multiple symptoms including chest discomfort, high temperature, cough with phlegm, and chills. Since we can't determine the single most common symptom from the given data, we can say the symptoms include chest discomfort, high temperature, cough with phlegm, and chills.\n",
