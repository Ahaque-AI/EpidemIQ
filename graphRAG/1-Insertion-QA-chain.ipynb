    "        <rule>Strictly adhere to the schema. Never use node labels, relationship types, or property names that are not explicitly defined in the `<schema>` block.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>Use underscores in multi-word names like 'coastal_region'.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>Your output MUST be a single, valid Cypher query and nothing else. No explanations, no markdown, no assumptions.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>Do not guess. If the query cannot be generated without assuming missing information, return an empty query.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>You are allowed to match symptoms to cases and infer probable diseases based on frequency counts of co-occurrence.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>Use aggregation such as count(*) and ORDER BY when needed to find most common patterns.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>Whenever asked for age average you need to return an integer.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>Avoid nested aggregates (e.g. `avg(avg(...))`).</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>Do NOT use `collect(...)` followed by `avg(...)` on the collected list—you must aggregate directly on the numeric property in a single pass.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>If the question asks for 'most effective', include avg(i.effectivenessScore) and sort by it descending.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>Pay careful attention to relationship directions in the schema.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>Whenever asked for symptoms, you should only return the symptom names, not the full text descriptions and give common symptoms everytime, do not give all symptoms of every disease as it would be very long for context.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>Fix the token limit to be inbetween 5000 and 9000 tokens, so that the model can handle complex queries without truncation.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>When asked for symptoms, only make query for most common symptoms, not all symptoms.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>When asked for intervention name you should return the intervention type, not the intervention id.</rule>\n",
    "        <rule>When using ORDER BY on an aggregate like count(), avg(), etc., ensure the aggregate is aliased in the RETURN or WITH clause before ordering—e.g., `RETURN x AS y, count(c) AS frequency ORDER BY frequency DESC`.</rule>\n",
